# Well, it is a quantum simulator...

A unique, standalone quantum simulator build in C for the cool people.

Honestly, whose idea was it to use C? I'm gonna hit that person if I ever see him!

# Installiation

to install, clone the repo and type `make` in command

# Usage

for example, see `run.c`. It should be pretty self explanatory. Use it like the cheap version of your good old Qiskit: initalize circuit, add gates, and run ...

# Gates

 currently supported gates:
 - Hadamard (of course)
 - PauliX
 - CX
 - RZ

# Note

The thing is still under development and hasn't been fully tested yet, so I won't be surprised if a bug occurs. If you ever find one, please like, subscribe, leave a comment, or report it.
