    general idea:
        read the circuit by circuit depth
        apply gate to each qubit
        pass resulting circuit onto measurement 

    how to deal with multi-qubit gate:
        since circuit have placeholder gates, all qubits affected by the
        gate will be in the same depth. 
        
        In this case we check the param_id and take tensor product
            should be a vector of [2xn] x 1 where n = num of qubits

        then map the vector with given gate to get final state vector V

        (need more research on the topic and proof it)
        resulting vector should give amplitude for each qubit in the form
        (assuming i start on 1):
            param_qubit[i].a = V[(n/(2i))-1] 
            param_qubit[i].b = V[(n/(2i))]
